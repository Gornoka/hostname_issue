# TEMPLATE REPO

use this repo to populate the base stuff we have in most of ou templates

1. use the templating feature or simply copy the stuff from this repo to your repo.
2. update the README.md
3. update the .github folder ( you will probably not need all workflows in one project)
4. create folder structure for your application (src for single application repos,
5. one for each package for container mono-repos)
